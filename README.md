# How to run the game
First of all make sure you are on the Windows platform as the game uses the <windows.h> library to control the graphics in the console and make sure you have installed a C compiler (eg. gcc). To compile the game just use the following command:
```bash
gcc main.c -o tower-of-hanoi.exe
```
After compiling it, you just have to run the file 'tower-of-hanoi.exe' just created.
